# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 16

The pourpouse of this module is obtain:
1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews

first we had to create an AWS RDS database with tables in pgAdmin, pick a dataset from the Amazon Review datasets (Links to an external site.), and extract the dataset into a DataFrame

The data that we select was:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Toys_v1_00.tsv.gz

We upload the transformed data into the appropriate tables and run queries in pgAdmin to confirm that the data has been uploaded.
